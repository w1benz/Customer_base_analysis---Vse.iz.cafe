This project involved analyzing key business metrics using PostgreSQL queries and visualizing the results in Yandex DataLens. The goal was to track performance trends and identify insights for decision-making.

### Tasks Completed:

**Wrote SQL queries to calculate core metrics:**
- DAU (Daily Active Users)
- Conversion Rate
- Average Purchase Value
- LTV (Lifetime Value)
- Retention Rate

Built a DataLens dashboard with interactive visualizations (line charts, tables) to monitor trends.
Performed time-based analysis (Mayâ€“June) to detect anomalies and growth patterns.

**Key Insights:**
- DAU trends: Increasing or declining active users.
- Conversion anomalies: Spikes or drops in user conversion.
- Average purchase trends: Changes in spending behavior.
- Retention dynamics: How well users stick over time.
- The dashboard provides a clear, actionable overview of business performance.
